# codeforlife
The main purpose of codeforlife is to implement algorithms for a better planning of emergency evacuations in public venues and raise awareness regarding emergency situations.

codeforlife allowed us to attract people interested in getting involved and to start a discussion with them about how we could all help. This is our way of engaging with the IT&C community differently, by raising awareness within communities around the globe. No matter if you just feel motivated to solve a problem or if you know a similar situation, where something can be planned, improved or optimized, we can work together to start building software which can make a difference in an emergency situation.

The 5 challenges in the hackathon described a situation where the participants had to compute the entire evacuation time expressed in a minimum number of iterations in a graph based on a number of individuals associated to each node. Application of such an algorithm: a set of cameras provide information about the number of people in each area of a public venue. Thus, real-time inputs can be read: the number of persons and their distribution by area (node) represent the first input. An alert can be raised (call to the authorities) when the maximum allowed evacuation time is exceeded for a venue.
